# Introduction

The missing semester is a student driven initiative to conduct lecture sessions by inviting experts to handle topics of interest to freshers. The two point purpose of missing semesster is : 
1. To cover some of the most important tools to be an effective learner.
2. To cover some of the cool ideas without subjecting anyone to the academic pressures of test/assignment/exams. 


<p style="text-align: justify;">
We emphasize a skill-based approach, which allows students to develop a deep understanding of the subject matter without resorting to rote memorization. The key to building confidence and proficiency in this subject lies in consistent practice; there are no shortcuts to mastering the art of problem-solving. To ensure your success, we strongly encourage regular attendance and active participation in class, as well as diligent preparation for tests and quizzes.

# Grading

You are gauranteed to get a grade based on your absolute total as described below :

| Score Range  | Grade Number |
|--------------|--------------|
| 95 and above | 10           |
| 90 - 94      | 9            |
| 85 - 89      | 8            |
| 80 - 84      | 7            |
| 70 - 79      | 6            |
| 60 - 69      | 5            |
| 50 - 59      | 4            |
|  0 - 49      | 3            |

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The grading will be absolute by default, but if the health of the class goes above 80, we will grade the class based on relative as well as absolute and consider the best of two.

# Securing a Pass Grade
A student is gauranteed a D grade if s/he can complete the following:

1. The student should have 90% attendance.
2. The student should have studied the first two chapters from the book *Linear Algebra* by Gilbert Strang and should be able to clear a viva voce on the topics from the first two chapters.
3. Finish the non-detail book.

The student can request for a viva voce in the last working week of the semester, just before the final exam.



# Project

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The project aims to assess students' understanding and application of concepts through in-depth exploration of a chosen topic. Students are expected to work in groups of up to four, producing a written report, video presentation, and participating in a viva-voce examination. Collaboration, consultation, and discussions are encouraged throughout the project. Students should begin working on their projects as early as possible to ensure ample time for research, collaboration, and addressing challenges. The project component provides a rewarding learning experience, fostering teamwork, research, and communication skills. Teams can choose any topic from the syllabus and dive deep into it. We will expect that you have studied and understood a lot more than what was taught to you. You are encouraged to implement an existing idea or read advanced material and create a report on it.

# Health of the Class

Academic health points of the class is accounted [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19YsSH_zUG3T2MUHDlt82Kdw5kRsulu8GQAm816bz7tQ/edit#gid=0). The instructor will update this sheet after every single class or more frequently than that. The class may lose health points if the instructor observes any violation of the classroom's code of conduct. On the other side, if we observe that the class is doing good, we may add more health points time and again. Some of the perks are as follows: 

1. Health is above 80, we will consider the best of Absolute and Relative Grade.
2. Health is above 80, we will consider the best of Track 1 and Track 2 mode.
3. Health of the class is above 100 points, we will give 5 full marks to everyone.
4. Health of the class is above 100 points, <u>we will drop 33.33% of the assignments, 33.33% of the test and 33.33% of the quiz</u>.



# Code of Conduct

1. We expect that the students do not indulge in any kind of malpractice/plagiarism or any other type of activities as discussed in the institute handbook. It is mandatory that you go through the handbook and agree to the expectations presented there.
2. We expect you to maintain decorum in the class at all times. 
3. The classes will start on time and we will provide the first 120 seconds for your to enter, after which there will be no entry to the class. If you knock on the door, it will result in a penalty of 1 mark and/or the revocation of any of the perks that are part of the course. The instructor may even reduce the academic health points of the class.
4. Read the Handbook and FAQ carefully before you contact the TAs/Instructor for any of your concerns. 
5. If you are found not following the rules and instructions as laid down in the Handbook/FAQ, the TA/Instructor may revoke one or more perks. 
6. To encourage peer interaction, the instructor will ring a bell to mark the beginning and end of interaction with your classmates. During the *peer interaction mode*, you will be allowed to move around in the class and talk to each other to discuss a concept or solve a problem. Once the instructor marks the end of peer interaction mode, you should get back to your place in less than 30 seconds and should remain silent, allowing the instructor to continue. Failure to comply may result in revoking of the perks. 
7. The instructor will expect perfect silence during the *lecture mode*, interacting with anyone in the class during the lecture mode is disallowed and may result in revoking of the perks. 
8. Unless or until the instructor/TA has permitted you to use your phone, your phone should be in switched off status. If your phone is found switched on or even in the aeroplane mode, it will be considered a violation of code of conduct. Keeping your phone in the non-switched off state (even in the aeroplane mode or in the silent mode) during your quiz/test will attract strict disciplinary action which may involve stamping an F grade. 

# Camera in the Classroom
The instructor may place one or more cameras and high definition microphone in order to record his lectures which will be made available later to the students. The instructor may also place cameras in the conspicuous places to record the classroom feed to impose decorum and to aid in invigilation. In case you have any objections to any of these, you should let the instructor know as early as possible and the instructor will help you with alternate arrangements.
