1. **What is the missing semester all about?**

The missing semester is a student driven initiative to conduct lecture sessions by inviting experts to handle topics of interest to freshers. Learning is at its best when we dont earmark your progress with marks and grades. Missing semester is an attmept to teach some of the great ideas in computer science the fun way.This also acts as a confidence booster for many students as they get to connect one on one with professors and some of the dedicated seniors students. 

2. **What will you be covering as part of the MS?**

We will start with some of the essential conceptual and computatinal toolkits for freshers and move ahead teaching prominent ideas in computer science. 

3. **I wont be able to attend the classes? Can I skip the upcoming class and show up on the next one?**

There is good demand for this course from students in and outside our branch. We would like to give preference for students who are sincerely attending the sessions. Our mentors will keep a note on who is attending and who isn't. Keep your mentor informed at all times. Also note that there is a threshold of the number of students a mentor can help. If a student is consistently missing the sessions, the mentor will replace him/her with a new student.

4. **I am finding it hectic to attend the sessions. Should I drop coming to the MS?**

We strongly suggest that you drop coming to the sessions if you are finding your semester hectic. 









3. **What if I am from a different branch other than CSE/AI. Can I attend the sessions?
