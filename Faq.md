1. **What if I am unable to make it to a class?**

Although we expect that you attend all the classes and dont miss any, it is impractical to expect 100% attendance. We are considerate enough to drop 20% of your quizzes, tests and assignments. No further requests on any grounds will be entertained for alternate arrangements or re-take of quiz/test/assignment. Irrespective of your engagement in any of the institute/national/international activities, we wont be able to accept any requests in this regard. Irrespective of any family or health emergency, we wont be relaxing this any further. Any persuasive attempts from the student will risk his/her perks. 

1. **I am not keeping well and I wont be able to attend the class/quiz/test, can you please help me with a re-quiz/re-test?**

    Respecting the exceptions that can occur, we are dropping 20% of the quiz, assignment and test marks. If you miss more than 20% of it, you are risking your marks. There wont be any re-quizzes or re-tests. If you miss the minor and major exam, institute rules will apply.

1. **I see that the students are asked to be seated in the order of their registration numbers. What is the reason?**
    
    Attendance in the course is not compulsory, but we may consider it to help you with some discretionary marks in case you are in the borderline for a grade jump. Taking attendance is an easier exercise if you are seated in an order. Another important reason why a proper seating arrangement is required, is to ensure that students do not copy during their quiz/test. In case they do, it is easier for us to monitor and track them through our surveillance equipments. 

1. **I am unable to see the board from the seat assigned to me. Can you please help?**

    Please feel free to talk to the instructor and ask him for a seat assignment in the front row. We will be happy to help.

1. **I am not comfortable with the camera being used in the class.**

    The cameras are mainly used for the following reasons:

        - It helps us mark the attendance easily. 
        - We use it for invigilation during tests and quizzes. 
        - We use it to monitor the classroom overall.

    For some reason if you dont want to be recorded, please talk to the instructor and we will be happy to help you with an alternative seating in the blindspot. But then different rules will apply if you are found violating the code of conduct which will be briefed to you with an undertaking.

1. **Is attendance compulsory?**
   
   No, but attendance will be taken for documentation reasons. If you are regular to the classes, the instructor may consider giving you some discretionary grace marks of at most 5. We strongly recommend that you attend all the classes. 

1. **The entire class would request for an off for a genuine reason. Is this possible?**
   
   Any request to cancel the class should be intimated at least 1 week in advance with a clear date of the compensatory class which is convenient for the instructor and all the students. The request should come through the course committee Chair who will ensure that the request is consensual for all students and that everyone is available during the compensatory class. The instructor may impose a penalty of 1-5 health points if the request is less reasonable. Any request to change the class timings without advance notice of at least one week will result in the deduction of 10 health points of the class. 

1. **How do I give my best in the course?**

   Please attend all the classes without fail. Effort required to prepare for the exams, is many folds less if one regularly attends the classes and gives their best in quizzes/tests/assignments. 

1. **I understand we should be on time for the class. How many minutes of delay is allowed?**

   We expect you to be in the class before the class commences. The door is latched 120 seconds after the commencement of classes. We want to discourage it in the interest of the class. Coming late for the class disturbs the entire class cognitively. 

1. **How do I share my feedback with the instructor?** 
   
   We have a [link to a google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbTmPY_GurY-UAc0sHV4lhfyqvs1SLCiJocWYhqtQFpP1c-g/viewform?usp=sf_link) which can be used to share your feedback with the instructor. This will be an anonymous form.

1. **What is the prescribed textbook for the course?**

   There is no one prescribed text for the course. You should use the content on the course homepage. Pointers to reference materials will either be provided in the class or in the course homepage.

1. The instructor uses a bell in the class, what is it meant for?

To encourage peer interaction, the instructor will ring a bell to mark the beginning and end of interaction with your classmates. During the peer interaction mode, you will be allowed to move around in the class and talk to each other to discuss a concept or solve a problem. Once the instructor marks the end of peer interaction, you should get back to your place in less than 30 seconds and should remain silent, allowing the instructor to continue. Failure to comply may result in revoking of the perks.
