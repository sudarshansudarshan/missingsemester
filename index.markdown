This is a homepage for the missing semester course for the Btech students across all branches. The first phase will involve training the CS and AI branch students. In a couple of weeks, we will also reach out to the other branch students if they are interested. An important document is the [handbook](/mathematicalfoundations/handbook/). Ensure that you read this document completely. Note that the [FAQ](/discretemath/faq/) section will keep growing, make sure you look it up once in a while.  

**News**
-  1 Aug: The website for the missing semester is up.
- 31 July: The student volunteers met to discuss on the logistics of the missing semester for the year 2023.
