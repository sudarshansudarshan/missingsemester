<h3 id="1-birthday-paradox">1. Birthday Paradox</h3>
<p>Given a bunch of 30 students in a class, there is a high chance that you have 2 people with the same birthday. Instead of 30, if the class has n students, what are the chances that you will find two people with the same birthday?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try writing a piece of python code which plots the probability Vs n</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We observe that the probability of we not having two people with the same birthday in a class of \(n\) people is given by :</p>

\[\frac{365}{365}.\frac{364}{365}.\frac{363}{365}\cdots \frac{(365-n)}{365}\]

<p>(There is a minor error in the above product. Can you identify?)</p>

<p>Let us call this \(f(n)\).</p>

\[f(n)=\left({1-\frac{0}{365}}\right).\left({1-\frac{1}{365}}\right).\left({1-\frac{2}{365}}\right)... \left({1-\frac{n}{365}} \right)\]

<p>We know that \(\left( 1-x\right)\approx e^{-x}\)</p>

<p>Therefore,</p>

\[f(n) \approx e^{\frac{-1}{365}}.e^{\frac{-2}{365}}.e^{\frac{-3}{365}}...e^{\frac{-n}{365}}\]

\[f(n)\approx e^{\frac{-n(n+1)/2}{365}}\]

<p>This simply tells us that for around 50 students in a class
\(f(50)\approx e^{\frac{-50(51)/2}{365}}=0.03\)</p>

<p>The probability of we finding two people with the same birthday is \(0.97\)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can you observe this empirically for 50 students? is the probability of success 0.97?</li>
  <li>Can you think of some application of this idea?</li>
  <li>When you put 50 balls in 365 baskets, uniformly at random, do you think that you can surely find a basket with atleast 2 balls?</li>
  <li>What do you have to say about birthday paradoxâ€™s relevance on planet Neptune where one year comprises of 60,000 days :-) ?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-finding-sqrt-10">2. Finding \(\sqrt 10\)</h3>

<p>Finding square root of 10 is equivalent to finding the root of the equation</p>

\[x^2 - 10 =0\]

<p>Note that one can observe that the root lies between 3 and 4, simply because considering \(f(x) = x^2 - 10\), \(f(3)&lt;0\) and \(f(4)&gt;0\).</p>

<p>This means the answer lies between 3 and 4.</p>

<p>One can further observe that the root lies between 3 and 3.5 and not between 3.5 and 4.</p>

<p>We can keep reducing the size of the interval this way.</p>

<p>Everytime, we reduce the interval by half.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that we can find the value of \(\sqrt{10}\) with increased accuracy with time.</p>

<p><strong>Observe: The rate at which we converge to the answer is logarithmic (why?)</strong></p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the above snippet of code finds the GCD of two numbers in lightening speed. It only takes logarithm in the \(min(a,b)\).</p>

<p><strong>Reason: Every step leads to a reduction in one of the numbers by half</strong></p>
