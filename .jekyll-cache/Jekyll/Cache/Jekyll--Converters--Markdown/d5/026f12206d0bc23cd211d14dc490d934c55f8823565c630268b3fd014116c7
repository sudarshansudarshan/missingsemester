The discrete mathematics course project aims to assess students' understanding and appreciation of the concepts presented throughout the course, as well as their development of the necessary skills to apply these ideas effectively. This project will provide students with a unique opportunity to explore a subject of their choice in greater depth, while fostering teamwork and collaboration.  

<br />
<br />


To complete the project, students may form groups of up to four members, with each group selecting a topic related to discrete mathematics that they find particularly intriguing. Students are encouraged to delve deeply into their chosen topic, conducting thorough research and analysis to develop a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

The final deliverables for the project will consist of both a written report and a video presentation. The report should be well-structured and clearly articulate the group's findings, insights, and conclusions. Meanwhile, the video presentation should offer a concise, engaging, and accessible explanation of the group's work, making it easy for viewers to grasp the key points and appreciate the significance of the project.
<br /> <br />

In addition to these deliverables, the evaluation process will also involve a viva-voce examination. This oral defense will provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter, as well as their ability to communicate complex ideas effectively. The viva-voce will serve as an important component of the assessment process, ensuring that students have truly internalized and appreciated the concepts they have explored.

<br /> <br />

Students are not only allowed but actively encouraged to seek guidance and engage in discussions with others throughout the course of the project. This includes consulting with peers, reaching out to instructors, or even seeking input from experts in the field. These discussions can help to refine the students' understanding, challenge their assumptions, and ultimately lead to a more thorough and well-rounded investigation of their chosen topic.

<br /> <br />

In summary, the discrete mathematics course project is designed to offer students a challenging and rewarding learning experience. By working together in small groups, students will have the opportunity to delve into a topic of their choosing, develop valuable research and communication skills, and demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter through a comprehensive report, video presentation, and viva-voce examination.

<br /> <br />


It is important to note that students should begin working on their projects by the middle of the semester. This will ensure that they have ample time to conduct thorough research, collaborate effectively with their group members, and refine their understanding of the topic. Starting early will also allow for any unforeseen challenges or obstacles to be addressed in a timely manner, ultimately leading to a higher-quality final submission. By allocating sufficient time and resources to the project, students will be better positioned to produce a well-rounded, insightful, and impactful exploration of their chosen subject in discrete mathematics.
