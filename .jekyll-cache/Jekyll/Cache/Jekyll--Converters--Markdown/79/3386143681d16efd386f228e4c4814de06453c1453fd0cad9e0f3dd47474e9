    <p>We encounter equations very often in our lives. Consider for example, the following situation at <strong><em>Bakerâ€™s Cafe</em></strong>. The manager has a very important estimate to make. Mostly, visitors at his cafe happen to be families and they are often comprised of Children and/or Adults. He observes that there are 3 adults and 1 child at a table and their bill turns out to be Rs.1200/-. There is yet another table with 2 children and 1 adult and their bill comes out to be Rs.1000/-. Can the manager estimate the consumption of a Child/Adult? This is popularly called the <em>Simultaneous Equations</em> and we all remember from our school days, multiple ways in which these can be solved.<br />
\(3A + 1C = 1200\) <br />
\(1A + 2C = 1000\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we were taught the so called two variables and two unknowns, what if there were more equations than unknowns?<br />
\(3A + 1C = 1200\) <br />
\(1A + 2C = 1000\)  <br />
\(1A + 1C =  900\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Note that the previous question can be modelled as a matrix:</p>

    <p>\(3A + 1C = 1200\) <br />
\(1A + 2C = 1000\)  <br />
\(1A + 1C =  900\)</p>

    <p><u>Observe</u> this is same as :</p>

    <p>\(\left( \begin{matrix} 3 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; 2 \\1 &amp; 1 \\\end{matrix}\right)\)
\(\left(
\begin{matrix}
B\\
C\\
\end{matrix}
\right)\)
=
\(\left(
 \begin{matrix}
 1200\\
 1000\\
 900\\
 \end{matrix}
\right)\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best way to solve is, is to guess the values :-). Can you write a python code to guess the values?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you solve this mathematically? There are two nice ways of solving this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Model this as a question of inverting a rectangular matrix and find the solution. (Whoa! my teacher never taught me that!)</li>
      <li>Model this as a funtion of two variables and solve it using partial differentiation (Eeks!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
