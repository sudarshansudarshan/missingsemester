<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This course is a gentle introduction to the mathematical preliminaries for modern computing. Some of the ideas in machine learning involves ideas from subjects such as linear algebra, probability and multivariate calculus. Although these topics are covered in undergraduate math courses in Indian Universities. Emphasis is more on problem solving than developing the required theory and intuition, which is crucial to understand some of the modern applications. The course is aimed at empowering a students with the required arsenal for understnading machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision with ease. 
</p>

<h1 id="expectations-from-the-course">Expectations from the course</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We emphasize a skill-based approach, which allows students to develop a deep understanding of the subject matter without resorting to rote memorization. The key to building confidence and proficiency in this subject lies in consistent practice; there are no shortcuts to mastering the art of problem-solving. To ensure your success, we strongly encourage regular attendance and active participation in class, as well as diligent preparation for tests and quizzes.

<p>We will consider the <u>maximum of Track 1 and Track 2 </u> provided the health of the class is above 80.</p>

<h1 id="securing-a-pass-grade">Securing a Pass Grade</h1>
<p>A student is gauranteed a D grade if s/he can complete the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The student should have 90% attendance.</li>
  <li>The student should have studied the first two chapters from the book <em>Linear Algebra</em> by Gilbert Strang and should be able to clear a viva voce on the topics from the first two chapters.</li>
  <li>Finish the non-detail book.</li>
</ol>

<p>The student can request for a viva voce in the last working week of the semester, just before the final exam.</p>

<h1 id="project">Project</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The project aims to assess students' understanding and application of concepts through in-depth exploration of a chosen topic. Students are expected to work in groups of up to four, producing a written report, video presentation, and participating in a viva-voce examination. Collaboration, consultation, and discussions are encouraged throughout the project. Students should begin working on their projects as early as possible to ensure ample time for research, collaboration, and addressing challenges. The project component provides a rewarding learning experience, fostering teamwork, research, and communication skills. Teams can choose any topic from the syllabus and dive deep into it. We will expect that you have studied and understood a lot more than what was taught to you. You are encouraged to implement an existing idea or read advanced material and create a report on it. 
</p>

<h1 id="course-committee">Course Committee</h1>

<p>The course committee will comprise of the following members:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Chairman:  Savi Juneja, 2023CSM1012, M.Tech. CSE</li>
  <li>Member 1: Subhra Sankar Mondal, 2023CSM1017, Mtech CSE</li>

  <li>Member 3: Rohit Kumar Choudhary, 2023CSZ0007, PhD</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="perks">Perks</h1>

<p>Perks of the course involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dropping any part of test/assignments/quiz.</li>
  <li>Evaluating the student on track 1 and track 2 and considering the best of two.</li>
  <li>Considering the best of absolute and relative, discretionary marks by the instructor.</li>
  <li>Dropping 20% of the assignments, 20% of the test and 20% of quiz.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="health-of-the-class">Health of the Class</h1>

<p>Academic health points of the class is accounted <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19YsSH_zUG3T2MUHDlt82Kdw5kRsulu8GQAm816bz7tQ/edit#gid=0">here</a>. The instructor will update this sheet after every single class or more frequently than that. The class may lose health points if the instructor observes any violation of the classroom’s code of conduct. On the other side, if we observe that the class is doing good, we may add more health points time and again. Some of the perks are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Health is above 80, we will consider the best of Absolute and Relative Grade.</li>
  <li>Health is above 80, we will consider the best of Track 1 and Track 2 mode.</li>
  <li>Health of the class is above 100 points, we will give 5 full marks to everyone.</li>
  <li>Health of the class is above 100 points, <u>we will drop 33.33% of the assignments, 33.33% of the test and 33.33% of the quiz</u>.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>

<ol>
  <li>We expect that the students do not indulge in any kind of malpractice/plagiarism or any other type of activities as discussed in the institute handbook. It is mandatory that you go through the handbook and agree to the expectations presented there.</li>
  <li>We expect you to maintain decorum in the class at all times.</li>
  <li>The classes will start on time and we will provide the first 120 seconds for your to enter, after which there will be no entry to the class. If you knock on the door, it will result in a penalty of 1 mark and/or the revocation of any of the perks that are part of the course. The instructor may even reduce the academic health points of the class.</li>
  <li>Read the Handbook and FAQ carefully before you contact the TAs/Instructor for any of your concerns.</li>
  <li>If you are found not following the rules and instructions as laid down in the Handbook/FAQ, the TA/Instructor may revoke one or more perks.</li>
  <li>To encourage peer interaction, the instructor will ring a bell to mark the beginning and end of interaction with your classmates. During the <em>peer interaction mode</em>, you will be allowed to move around in the class and talk to each other to discuss a concept or solve a problem. Once the instructor marks the end of peer interaction mode, you should get back to your place in less than 30 seconds and should remain silent, allowing the instructor to continue. Failure to comply may result in revoking of the perks.</li>
  <li>The instructor will expect perfect silence during the <em>lecture mode</em>, interacting with anyone in the class during the lecture mode is disallowed and may result in revoking of the perks.</li>
  <li>Unless or until the instructor/TA has permitted you to use your phone, your phone should be in switched off status. If your phone is found switched on or even in the aeroplane mode, it will be considered a violation of code of conduct. Keeping your phone in the non-switched off state (even in the aeroplane mode or in the silent mode) during your quiz/test will attract strict disciplinary action which may involve stamping an F grade.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="camera-in-the-classroom">Camera in the Classroom</h1>
<p>The instructor may place one or more cameras and high definition microphone in order to record his lectures which will be made available later to the students. The instructor may also place cameras in the conspicuous places to record the classroom feed to impose decorum and to aid in invigilation. In case you have any objections to any of these, you should let the instructor know as early as possible and the instructor will help you with alternate arrangements.</p>
