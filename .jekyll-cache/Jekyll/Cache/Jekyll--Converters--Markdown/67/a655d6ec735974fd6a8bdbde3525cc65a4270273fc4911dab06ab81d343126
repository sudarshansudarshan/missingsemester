<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What is scaling? What is a scalar? What is a vector?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you add two vectors? What is its physical significance?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you mulitply a scalar with a vector? Think of an application.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What is \(\hat{i}\) vector and a \(\hat{j}\) vector. Why are they important?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why not consider any other basis vectors instead of the standard unit vectors?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can one get any vector from the basis vectors? What is the intuition?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does one mean by the linear combination of two vectors? What does one mean by the “span” of two vectors?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are all possible vectors one can reach in three dimensions, by using some two vectors? Use geogebra to get the right intuition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are vectors same as points? Think of an application where we would like to use the term vectors and not points, and vice versa.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When do you call vectors as linearly independent and when do you call them linearly dependent?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can you give an example of three vectors in three dimension whose linear span is the line of infinite length passing through \((0,0,0)\) and \((1,1,1)\) ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the <strong>technical definition of basis</strong> make sense? (The last part of the video).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Think of a function that takes points in 2-dimension and maps them to points in 2-dimension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you think a matrix does the same?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a matrix that maps (1,2) to (3,4) and (4,5) to (1,1). Can you find out that matrix? Can there be two such matrices? Why or why not?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you see how a matrix multiplied with a column vector (x,y) is the same as the span of two vectors?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What is the importance of composition of two matrices in the context of our playing around with an image <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/ysulyma/matrix/">here</a>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that two numbers a and b have this property that ab=ba. Do you think this is true for matrices? Give an example to validate your answer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Consider a matrix with a small determinant and check <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/ysulyma/matrix/">playing around with the image</a>.</p>

    <p>What if the determinant of the matrix is big?</p>
