|Lecture 1| Introduction Class + Graph Theory| [Link to the Classroom Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukOOZfCJo3U)|

# Graphs 
We introduced the idea of Graphs. {% include youtube.html id="-peAUmrm4RM" %}.

# Handshaking Lemma
We spoke about handshakes in the classroom and how we can model it using Graphs. {% include youtube.html id="szOGC5OxJBY" %} By degree, we mean the number of lines that are adjacent on a point, or simply speaking, the number of friends that a person keeps

# Isomorphic Graphs 
We saw how two graphs that are appearingly different can actually be the same.

1. **Quiz**: Are the following two graphs the same?<br>
![C5](/discretemath/assets/images/c5.png){: width="200" height="200"}
![Star](/discretemath/assets/images/star.png){: width="200" height="200"}

1. **Test**: Are the following two graphs the same?<br>
![C5](/discretemath/assets/images/10node_labelled.png){: width="200" height="200"}
![Star](/discretemath/assets/images/10node_unlabelled.png){: width="200" height="200"}

1. **Quiz**: Understand how the graphs as illustrated in the lecture ([link](https://youtu.be/ukOOZfCJo3U?t=2607)), are not isomorphic. Why? Google for Petersen Graph for some fun reading. 

1. **Test**: If you are given two graphs on 100 nodes, how can one write a piece of code to find out if these two graphs are the same or not? What is the complexity involved in finding this out?
