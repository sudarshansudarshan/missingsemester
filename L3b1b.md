# Chapter 1

1. What is scaling? What is a scalar? What is a vector?

2. How do you add two vectors? What is its physical significance?

3. How do you mulitply a scalar with a vector? Think of an application.

# Chapter 2

1. What is $$\hat{i}$$ vector and a $$\hat{j}$$ vector. Why are they important?

2. Why not consider any other basis vectors instead of the standard unit vectors? 

3. How can one get any vector from the basis vectors? What is the intuition?

4. What does one mean by the linear combination of two vectors? What does one mean by the "span" of two vectors?

5. What are all possible vectors one can reach in three dimensions, by using some two vectors? Use geogebra to get the right intuition. 

6. Are vectors same as points? Think of an application where we would like to use the term vectors and not points, and vice versa.

7. When do you call vectors as linearly independent and when do you call them linearly dependent?

8. Can you give an example of three vectors in three dimension whose linear span is the line of infinite length passing through $$(0,0,0)$$ and $$(1,1,1)$$ ?

9. Why does the __technical definition of basis__ make sense? (The last part of the video).

# Chapter 3

1. Think of a function that takes points in 2-dimension and maps them to points in 2-dimension.

2. Do you think a matrix does the same?

3. We have a matrix that maps (1,2) to (3,4) and (4,5) to (1,1). Can you find out that matrix? Can there be two such matrices? Why or why not?

4. Do you see how a matrix multiplied with a column vector (x,y) is the same as the span of two vectors?

# Chapter 4

1. What is the importance of composition of two matrices in the context of our playing around with an image [here](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/ysulyma/matrix/)?

2. We know that two numbers a and b have this property that ab=ba. Do you think this is true for matrices? Give an example to validate your answer.

# Chapter 5

1. Consider a matrix with a small determinant and check [playing around with the image](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/ysulyma/matrix/).

2. What if the determinant of the matrix is big?

3. What if the determinant is -ve?

4. What do you think the determinant denotes?

5. Fill up the RHS. (_T_ stands for Transpose and _det_ stands for determinant) :

- $$ (A^T)^T = ?$$
- $$ (A+B)^T = ?$$
- $$ (AB)^T = ?$$
- $$ (A^{-1})^T = ? $$
- $$ \alpha(M^T)= ? $$
- $$ det(AB)= ?$$
- $$ det(A^T) = ?$$
- $$ det (A^{-1}) = ?$$
- $$ det (\alpha M) = ? $$
