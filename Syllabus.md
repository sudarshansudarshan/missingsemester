The following syllabus will be covered as part of this course. The syllabus is just for reference. We will be covering The approach was exploraratory and case study based. We used inuition in place of abstraction. By the end of the course, the students were able to get the right intuition for the importance of probability, linear algebra and calculus in data science related applications. The students will now be ready to take up hardcore math ideas in ML/AI/DS.
